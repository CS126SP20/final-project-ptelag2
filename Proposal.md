# Escape The Ceiling

Author: Praval Telagi

The application I would like to create for my final project is a game where the user must try and move a square to not hit the
top of the screen. The square will be continuously moving upwards on the screen with small holes in the floor to allow it to 
fall. The user can control the square using the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard to navigate to these openings. As 
the game progresses, the rate at which the floors and square move up will increase, making the game more difficult. There will 
also be a system in place to keep track of the 3 top scores in the game.

When I got my first iPod touch back in 2010, this was similar to one of the first games I downloaded. I recently found the 
iPod in my house and decided to plug in it and see what is on it. I noticed this game that I used to play for hours and hours 
trying to beat my previous score and thought creating something similar to this would be really interesting and fun to do for 
my final project. Although it wasn't a super exciting application, it still remains one of my favorite mobile games today.

The library I would like to use is called RapidJSON. This allows easy parsing and generating of JSON files. I would like to 
save each score in a JSON file which is why this library would be ideal for my application. Here is the link to the repository 
on github: https://github.com/Tencent/rapidjson

By the end of week 1, I would like to have the visuals of the game completed. I want to be able to press run and have at least 
a stationary game printed on the board. At the end of week 2, the game should be almost completely playable, but at the least, 
the floors should be moving upwards on the screen and the square should be able to fall through the holes. Finally, at the end 
of week 3, I would like to have the scoring system developed that saves the scores to a JSON file. 

If I were to finish this project early, I would like to implement different levels of difficulty in the game. Different 
difficulties could be like having the starting speed be fast on the harder setting.
